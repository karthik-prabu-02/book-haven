        aboutAuthor:'Born in Dublin in 1854, Oscar Wilde was educated at home till the age of nine. He attended the Portora Royal School, Enniskillen from 1864 to 1871. In 1874, he graduated from Trinity College, Dublin. Wilde’s first play, Vera: or the Nihilists, did not meet much success. He refined his ideas about art, its purpose and supremacy, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). Continuing his interest in theatre he wrote Salome, a play in one act, in 1891. Wilde became one of the most successful playwrights of the late Victorian London after producing four comedies—Lady Windermere’s Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband, and The Importance of Being Earnest. First performed in 1895 in collaboration with George Alexander at St. James’s Theater, London, The Importance of Being Earnest was considered Wilde’s masterpiece and continues to remain his most popular play. The Ballad of Reading Gaol, published in 1898, was his last work. Wilde died in 1900 at the age of 46, in Paris.',

        about:'THE SOUL IS A TERRIBLE REALITY. IT CAN BE BOUGHT AND SOLD AND BARTERED AWAY.” Meet Dorian Gray, the beautiful young man with an impossibly charming face and spirit. As he sits for Basil Hallward—a deeply moral artist and a friend of the impish Lord Henry—who becomes obsessed with his beauty and wants to paint him, Dorian is enchanted by the perfection of his portrait. But, influenced by the well-phrased epigrams of the hedonist Lord Henry on the transience of youth and beauty, Dorian becomes jealous of it and wishes that the portrait bear the scars of his passing youth and age, while he would remain young forever. And Alas, his wish comes true! Enticed into dissolution and degradation while his portrait is aging in the attic, Dorian engages in scandals and sinful pleasures. We see him go from good to evil. But is he any happier? The only novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an arresting moral commentary and a classic example of Gothic fiction. With an unparalleled depiction of the Faustian bargain, this parable of aesthetic ideal remains a literary masterpiece almost 125 years after its publication.',

        Charles Marlow, an English seaman, narrates his journey
        up the River Congo in search of an ivory trader named
        Mr. Kurtz. As he sails into the heart of Africa, from the company’s outer station to the central and inner stations, he comes across scenes of brutality, torture, slavery and horror.
        What happens when Marlow finally meets Kurtz?
        A journey not only into the depths of the African jungles but also into the dark recesses of the human soul, Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is a critical exploration of the spinechilling truths and hypocrisy of the European colonialism.
        The novella has undergone several adaptations across radio, theatre, television and motion pictures. It continues to remain one of Conrad’s outstanding works.`,

        aboutAuthor:`Frank Herbert's classic masterpiece--a triumph of the imagination and one of the bestselling science fiction novels of all time.

        Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the "spice" melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for....
        
        When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul's family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.
        
        A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.
        About the Author: Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer.
        
        In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with "Looking for Something?" in Startling Stories. But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune. Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call "one of the monuments of modern science fiction." Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague, The Dosadi Experiment, and Destination: Void. He died in 1986.

The Jews he saved used to say, 'Thank God he was more faithful to us than to his wife.' Will the enigma ever be solved? Schindler is not here to tell us, and the survivors are uncertain and differ in their opinions. The establishment and Schindler's business associates in Krakow had opposing views of his ethics and would have preferred to sit on the fence and hope the Schindler story would retreat into the archives. Schindler's friends and enemies accept that he was a very unusual man. A few of the Jews that he saved maintain, after all these years, that they still consider him a Nazi and exploiter of Jewish slave labor. Others swear their love for the man. That he used Jewish slave labor to enrich himself is not questioned, nor are his endeavors to eventually save his Jewish laborers. The author forensically re-examines the life and times of Oskar Schindler with surprising results.",

        about:`In the twenty-second century Earth obtains limitless, free energy from a source science little understands: an exchange between Earth and a parallel universe, using a process devised by the aliens. But even free energy has a price. The transference process itself will eventually lead to the destruction of the Earth's Sun--and of Earth itself.

        Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun. They know the truth--but who will listen? They have foreseen the cost of abundant energy--but who will believe? These few beings, human and alien, hold the key to Earth's survival.
        About the Author: Isaac Asimov began his Foundation series at the age of twenty-one, not realizing that it would one day be considered a cornerstone of science fiction. During his legendary career, Asimov penned more than 470 books on subjects ranging from science to Shakespeare to history, though he was most loved for his award-winning science fiction sagas, which include the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series. Named a Grand Master of Science Fiction by the Science Fiction Writers of America, Asimov entertained and educated readers of all ages for close to five decades. He died, at the age of seventy-two, in April 1992.`,

        about:`Discussed and debated from time immemorial, the concept of personal liberty went without codification until the 1859 publication of On Liberty. John Stuart Mill's complete and resolute dedication to the cause of freedom inspired this treatise, an enduring work through which the concept remains well known and studied.
        The British economist, philosopher, and ethical theorist's argument does not focus on the so-called Liberty of the Will...but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. Mill asks and answers provocative questions relating to the boundaries of social authority and individual sovereignty. In powerful and persuasive prose, he declares that there is one very simple principle regarding the use of coercion in society -- one may only coerce others either to defend oneself or to defend others from harm.
        The new edition offers students of political science and philosophy, in an inexpensive volume, one of the most influential studies on the nature of individual liberty and its role in a democratic society.`,

Popper's highly accessible style, his erudite and lucid explanations of the thought of great philosophers and the recent resurgence of totalitarian regimes around the world are just three of the reasons for the enduring popularity ofThe Open Society and Its Enemies, and for why it demands to be read both today and in years to come.

        about:`Tracking the development of Foucault's key concepts

        Lemke offers the most comprehensive and systematic account of Michel Foucault's work on power and government from 1970 until his death in 1984. He convincingly argues, using material that has only partly been translated into English, that Foucault's concern with ethics and forms of subjectivation is always already integrated into his political concerns and his analytics of power. The book also shows how the concept of government was taken up in different lines of research in France before it gave rise to governmentality studies in the Anglophone world.
        
        Foucault's Analysis of Modern Governmentality provides a clear and well-structured exposition that is theoretically challenging but also accessible for a wider audience. Thus, the book can be read both as an original examination of Foucault's concept of government and as a general introduction to his genealogy of power.
        About the Author: Thomas Lemke is Heisenberg Professor of sociology at Goethe University, Frankfurt. He has authored widely cited works on social theory, with a focus on governmentality.`,

        about:`In 1930, the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain's 'conscious and deliberate bleeding of India... [was the] greatest crime in all history'. He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British-in famines, epidemics, communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919. Besides the deaths of Indians, British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country, in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire, India's share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent.
        The British empire in India began with the East India Company, incorporated in 1600, by royal charter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I, to trade in silk, spices and other profitable Indian commodities. Within a century and a half, the Company had become a power to reckon with in India. In 1757, under the command of Robert Clive, Company forces defeated the ruling Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal at Plassey, through a combination of superior artillery and even more superior chicanery. A few years later, the young and weakened Mughal emperor, Shah Alam II, was browbeaten into issuing an edict that replaced his own revenue officials with the Company's representatives. Over the next several decades, the East India Company, backed by the British government, extended its control over most of India, ruling with a combination of extortion, double-dealing, and outright corruption backed by violence and superior force. This state of affairs continued until 1857, when large numbers of the Company's Indian soldiers spearheaded the first major rebellion against colonial rule. After the rebels were defeated, the British Crown took over power and ruled the country ostensibly more benignly until 1947, when India won independence. 
        In this explosive book, bestselling author Shashi Tharoor reveals with acuity, impeccable research, and trademark wit, just how disastrous British rule was for India. Besides examining the many ways in which the colonizers exploited India, ranging from the drain of national resources to Britain, the destruction of the Indian textile, steel-making and shipping industries, and the negative transformation of agriculture, he demolishes the arguments of Western and Indian apologists for Empire on the supposed benefits of British rule, including democracy and political freedom, the rule of law, and the railways. The few unarguable benefits-the English language, tea, and cricket-were never actually intended for the benefit of the colonized but introduced to serve the interests of the colonizers. Brilliantly narrated and passionately argued, An Era of Darkness will serve to correct many misconceptions about one of the most contested periods of Indian

        about:`Events in West Asia constantly demand global attention due to regional conflicts, faith-based divisions, sectarian violence and wars that are often ignited by external powers. Popular agitations for political, economic and social reform frequently make the scenario even more fragile, turbulent and uncertain.West Asia is a destination for millions of pilgrims to sacred sites venerated by the three Abrahamic faiths - Islam, Christianity and Judaism. It is also at the heart of global energy, trade and financial dynamics, the centre of logistical connectivity projects, and an emerging hub of technological research and development. As a new world order asserts its claims across Eurasia and the Indian Ocean, West Asia is witnessing new diplomatic initiatives to reshape regional alignments and define the new order. Developments here are of abiding concern for India - it is closely tied to the region in terms of energy, trade, investment, logistical connectivity and the interests of its eight-million strong resident community.West Asia at War, written by veteran Indian diplomat Talmiz Ahmad, combines an understanding of the diverse forces that are shaping the politics and economics of this region, and paints a portrait that is at once grim, painful, colourful and exciting. About the Author Talmiz Ahmad joined the Indian Foreign Service in 1974 and was posted to Kuwait, Iraq and Yemen, and then as Consul General in Jeddah, in 1987-90. After appointments in New York, London and Pretoria, he became the head of the Gulf and Hajj Division in the Ministry of External Affairs in 1998-2000.He did two stints as ambassador to Saudi Arabia, besides being ambassador to Oman and the UAE, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and Director General of the Indian Council of World Affairs.After retirement from foreign service in 2011, he was in the corporate sector in Dubai and then, from 2016, has been a full-time academic.

        about:`India has the second-largest legal profession in the world, but the systemic delays and chronic impediments of its judicial system inspire little confidence in the common person. In India's Legal System, renowned constitutional expert and senior Supreme Court lawyer Fali S. Nariman explores possible reasons. While realistically appraising the criminal justice system and the performance of legal practitioners, he elaborates the different aspects of contemporary practice, such as public interest litigation, judicial review and activism. In lucid, accessible language, Nariman discusses key social issues such as inequality and affirmative action, providing real cases as illustrations of the on-ground situation.

        This frank and thought-provoking book offers valuable insights into India's judicial system and maps a possible road ahead to make justice available to all.

        about:`In the early 1990s, E.M.S. Namboodiripad (1909-1998) came across the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937). Gramsci, one of the most significant communist theorists of his time, had spent his time in prison writing essays and notes to clarify the situation of the communist revolution in Italy, and the victory of the fascist forces. These writings, written in secret over a decade (1929-1937) largely in the prison of Turi near Bari, were smuggled out by Gramsci's family, preserved by his comrades, and then published first a little over a decade after Gramsci's death.It was P. Govinda Pillai (1926-2012) - known to his comrades as PG - who had first given EMS a volume of Gramsci's Prison Notebooks. EMS read part of it and jokingly chided PG for not giving him Gramsci's work to read a decade or more earlier as he found himself astounded by the great quality of the theoretical assessments in it.By now in his early 80s, EMS told PG to write a book about Gramsci in Malayalam. PG said that he would only do so if EMS wrote it with him, so the two of them got to work. An early fruit of the reading EMS had done was published in The Marxist in 1995. The next year, EMS and PG released a full book on Gramsci's thought in Malayalam.This book - translated by PG's son M.G. Radhakrishnan - is the English version of that effort.`,

        about:`Design doesn't have to complicated, which is why this guide to human-centered design shows that usability is just as important as aesthetics.

        Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door.
        
        The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive Philosophy. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.
        
        The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.
        
        The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.`,

        about:`From Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times bestselling author Robert Shiller, a groundbreaking account of how stories help drive economic events--and why financial panics can spread like epidemic viruses

        Stories people tell--about financial confidence or panic, housing booms, or Bitcoin--can go viral and powerfully affect economies, but such narratives have traditionally been ignored in economics and finance because they seem anecdotal and unscientific. In this groundbreaking book, Robert Shiller explains why we ignore these stories at our peril--and how we can begin to take them seriously. Using a rich array of examples and data, Shiller argues that studying popular stories that influence individual and collective economic behavior--what he calls "narrative economics"--may vastly improve our ability to predict, prepare for, and lessen the damage of financial crises and other major economic events. The result is nothing less than a new way to think about the economy, economic change, and economics. In a new preface, Shiller reflects on some of the challenges facing narrative economics, discusses the connection between disease epidemics and economic epidemics, and suggests why epidemiology may hold lessons for fighting economic contagions.`,

Dowling on the occasion of his 65th birthday. Containing contributions from more than 50 of John's colleagues, representing a Who's Who of the vision research community, this work not only provides a memento of the occasion, but will hopefully serve as a basic reference for future researchers in retinal biology.

        The volume is divided somewhat arbitrarily into seven areas of retinal research containing chapters that present in some cases a broad overview of a particular topic, and in others an account of current research and studies in progress. These chapters exemplify the richness, diversity, and excitement of contemporary retinal research. They also remind us of how much more needs to be done before we understand fully the interrelationship between retinal neurons, the complex interactions between neurons and glial cells, and the mechanisms that govern retinal development.
        
        A final chapter contributed by John Dowling provides an overview of past accomplishments, and offers some future perspectives on retinal research in the 21st century.`,

        about:`Low-molecular-weight chemicals, which are produced and secreted by neurons and a limited range of non-neural cells, are the major vehicles for communication of nerve cells with each other and with neurally controlled non-neural cells. Research over the past several decades has identified a wide spectrum of such neuromediators, delineated their structures, elucidated pathways of biosynthesis and biodegradation, and determined the processes of development and function that they influence physiologically. These results have revealed the nature of cellular receptors that recognize neuromediators selectively and the pathways that transduce signals from neuromediator-occupied receptors to the target cells. For most neuromediators and their receptors, pharmacological agonists and antagonists of high specificity also have been discovered or designed and synthesized.

        In the past decade, a broad range of animal models has been developed in which modern genetic methods have allowed overexpression and deletion of neuromediators and/or of their receptors for sophisticated analyses of their roles in normal physiology and some diseases. The availability of pharmacological agents directed to neuromediators or their receptors also has stimulated early studies of the involvement of these systems in some human diseases. At the same time as these revolutionary advances, most established conference series dedicated to this subject area have become narrower and have focused more sharply on individual neuromediators to permit deeper and more penetrating presentations and discussions.

        At this time, it seems appropriate to organize a volume that examines the conceptual, methodological, and practical progress in the field from broader biological and pathophysiological perspectives. This volume describes a new international conference in the integrated field of neuromediators that has no predecessors and is set in a biomedical context of possible diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

        about:"Infrastructure development in Africa and Asia is expanding at breakneck speed, largely in biodiversity-rich developing nations. The trend reflects governments' efforts to promote economic growth in response to increasing populations, rising consumption rates and persistent inequalities. Large-scale infrastructure development is regularly touted as a way to meet the growing demand for energy, transport and food - and as a key to poverty alleviation. In practice, however, road networks, hydropower dams and 'development corridors' tend to have adverse effects on local populations, natural habitats and biodiversity. Such projects typically weaken the capacity of ecosystems to maintain ecological functions on which wildlife and human communities depend, particularly in the face of climate change.

        For Nivedita Menon, feminism is not about a moment of final triumph over patriarchy but about the gradual transformation of the social field so decisively that old markers shift forever. From sexual harassment charges against international figures to the challenge that caste politics poses to feminism, from the ban on the veil in France to the attempt to impose skirts on international women badminton players, from queer politics to domestic servants' unions to the Pink Chaddi campaign, Menon deftly illustrates how feminism complicates the field irrevocably.

She explains how our thoughts and words affect the experience we have in our daily lives, and uses concrete examples to show how we can use them to bring more of what we want into our lives, including abundance, love and success. A wonderful and simple-to-follow book on the power of right thinking. 
        This little book has inspired thousands of people around the world to find a sense of purpose and belonging. Whatever we send out into the world will eventually be returned to us, which means that if we give love, we will be loved, but if we hate we will in turn feel hated. Through what we give and receive, we shape our reality. 
        The book includes the following chapters: # The Game # The Law of Prosperity # The Power of the Word # The Law of Nonresistance # The Law of Karma and the Law of Forgiveness # Casting the Burden Impressing the Subconscious # Love # Intuition or Guidance # Perfect Self Expression or the Divine Design # Denials and Affirmations ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Florence Scovel Shinn was a woman ahead of her time. To many, she is considered to be among the likes of James Allen, Wallace D. Wattles and Napoleon Hill. She had the ability to explain her success principles and how they work in an entertaining and easy-to-read style.
        She can be considered one of last century's most popular success teachers. Florence Scovel Shinn was born on September 24, 1871, in Camden, New Jersey to Alden Cortland Scovel and Emily Hopkinson. She had an older sister and a younger brother. She was educated at Friends Central School in Philadelphia. She later studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts from 1889 to 1897. While there, she met Everett Shinn, a painter of impressionistic canvases and realistic murals. They married shortly after Florence graduated from the art academy. The Shinns moved to New York where both pursued their separate careers, Everett in the theatre while Florence did illustrations for children's literature in magazines and books. In 1925, Florence decided to publish her first book 'The Game of Life and How to Play It'. After unsuccessfully finding a publisher for her work, she published it herself. Her second book, 'Your Word is Your Wand' followed in 1928 and her final book 'The Secret Door to Success' was published in 1940 shortly before her death on October 17, 1940. A fourth book, 'The Power of the Spoken Word' is a compendium of her notes, gathered by one of her students and published posthumously in 1945.

Father Cochem authored such works as "The Last Four Things" and "The Incredible Catholic Mass," the former of which was printed by TAN in 1987. He died on the tenth of September, 1712, at Waghausel.`,

        aboutAuthor:"Arundhati Roy is an Indian writer, best known for her book The God of Small Things (1997), which won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. She was born in Shillong, Meghalaya, India. Her parents were Rajib Roy, a Bengali Hindu tea plantation anager from Calcutta and Mary Roy, a Malayali Syrian Christian women's rights activist from Kerala. When she was two, her parents divorced, and she returned with her mother and brother to Kerala. For some time, the family lived with her maternal grandfather in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. When she was 5, the family moved back to Kerala, where her mother started a school. Roy began writing her first novel, The God of Small Things, in 1992, completing it in 1996. The book is semi-autobiographical in nature. It captures a major part of her childhood experiences in Aymanam. This book gave Arundhati Roy international fame and was also a commercial success. After that she wrote several non-fiction books which includes The End of Imagination (a critique against the Indian government's nuclear policies), The Algebra of Infinite Justice, Listening to Grasshoppers, War Talk and Walking with Comrades. Her second novel, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, was published in June 2017, 20 years after her first novel. It has been chosen for the Man Booker Prize 2017 Long List. She currently lives in Delhi.",

        about:'Set in Kerala in the 1960s, The God of Small Things is about two children, Estha and Rahel, and the shocking consequences of a pivotal event in their young lives, the accidental death-by-drowning of a visiting English cousin. In magical and poetic language, the novel paints a vivid picture of life in a small rural Indian town, the thoughts and feelings of the two small children, and the complexity and hypocrisy of the adults in their world. It is also a poignant lesson in the destructive power of the caste system and moral and political bigotry in general.',

Under an Indian military rule that, at half a million strong, exceeds the total number of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, freedom of speech is non-existent, and human- rights abuses and atrocities are routinely visited on its Muslim-majority population. In the last two decades alone, over seventy thousand people have died. Ignored by its own corrupt politicians, abandoned by Pakistan and the West, which refuses to bring pressure to bear on its regional ally, India, the Kashmiri people's ongoing quest for justice and self- determination continues to be brutally suppressed. Exploring the causes and consequences of the occupation, Kashmir: The Case for Freedom is a passionate call for the end of occupation, and for the right of self- determination for the Kashmiri people.",

        Stephen Coonts' newest novel The Russia Account pits CIA officer Tommy Carmellini against a murderous, international financial conspiracy that leaves a trail of death and corruption, extending from a small bank in Estonia, to the highest reaches of the Kremlin, to the halls of the Congress, and perhaps even to the CIA itself -- putting Admiral Jake Grafton, the head of the CIA, in the crosshairs of an assassin.
        
        Burglar turned CIA warrior Tommy Carmellini has starred in eight previous Coonts' thrillers, from Liars and Thieves to Coonts' latest from Regnery, The Armageddon File. Realistic, passionate, in love with life, Tommy struggles in our turbulent age. Critics have labeled him a "hip, modern hero." With the help of his mentor Jake Grafton, up to now Carmellini has always managed to foil his enemies. Discovering and defeating the powerful forces behind this massive, blood-stained financial conspiracy that threatens the very foundations of the United States government will be his most difficult challenge. Perhaps, he suspects, an impossible one.`,

        Every war has its "bridge"--Old North Bridge at Concord, Burnside's Bridge at Antietam, the railway bridge over Burma's River Kwai, the bridge over Germany's Rhine River at Remagen, and the bridges over Korea's Toko Ri. In Vietnam it was the bridge at Thanh Hoa, called Dragon's Jaw. For many years hundreds of young US airmen flew sortie after sortie against North Vietnam's formidable and strategically important bridge, dodging a heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire, surface-to-air missiles and enemy fighters. Many American airmen were shot down, killed, or captured and taken to the infamous POW prisons in Hanoi. But after each air attack, when the smoke cleared and the debris settled, the bridge stubbornly remained standing. For the North Vietnamese it became a symbol of their invincibility; for US war planners an obsession; for US airmen a testament to American mettle and valor. Using after-action reports, official records, and interviews with surviving pilots, as well as previously untapped Vietnamese sources, Dragon's Jaw chronicles American efforts to destroy the bridge, strike by bloody strike, putting readers into the cockpits, under fire. The story of the Dragon's Jaw is a story rich in bravery, audacity, sometimes luck and sometimes tragedy. The "bridge" story of Vietnam is an epic tale of war against a determined foe.`,

        "[A] headline-inspired thriller with a conservative slant." --Publishers Weekly
        
        After one of the most contentious and divisive elections in American history, the new president is finally settling into the West Wing. But when his chief of staff discovers evidence that voting machines in key counties in swing states were tampered with, the whole administration is in danger of unraveling. Did someone steal the election? Are America's enemies involved? Were the tampered-with machines actually rigged to swing the election the other way--and if so and the plot failed, what is the conspirators' backup plan?
        
        Jake Grafton and Tommy Carmellini race to solve the mystery of a potentially rigged election before Americans' full faith and credit in our democracy, sovereignty, and rule of law become completely undone.

The Deep Black team stumbles across an even more alarming secret--a plot to assassinate the Russian president and overthrow the democratic government by force. The coup could have dire consequences for Russia and the world. With no clearance from the government it's called on to protect, the National Security Agency goes to war. But before Lia and Dean can unravel the conspiracy, they learn that one of the spy plane's passengers--an NSA techie--survived the crash. Critical information could fall into enemy hands. And that enemy is playing to the death.

Flynn has published three novels, which are all thrillers: Sharp bjects, Dark Places, and Gone Girl. While growing up, Flynn was "painfully shy" and found escape in reading and writing. Flynn's father used to take her to watch horror movies. She received her undergraduate degrees in English and journalism from the University of Kansas. She spent two years in California, writing for a trade magazine for human resources professionals. Then she moved to Chicago and attended Northwestern University for a master's degree in Journalism, in 1997 Flynn initially wanted to work as a police reporter, but she chose to do writing, as she discovered she had "no aptitude" for police reporting. She says that she is a writer due to her 15-some years in journalism. Some critics have accused Flynn of unflattering depiction of female characters in her books. Flynn identifies herself as a feminist and feels that feminism allows for women to be bad characters in literature. She says that she has grown weary of the “the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul- searching fashionistas”. She particularly mourns the lack of good, potent, female villains.`,

She makes a decent wage - mostly by telling people what they want to hear. But then she meets Susan Burke. Susan moved to the city one year ago with her husband and 15-year old stepson Miles. They live in a Victorian house called Carterhook Manor, built in 1893. Susan has become convinced that some malevolent spirit is inhabiting their home, and taking possession of the stepson. She has even found trickles of blood on the wall. The young woman doesn't believe in exorcism or the supernatural, but she does see an opportunity to make a lot of money. However when she enters the house for the first time, and meets Miles, she begins to feel it too, as if the very house is watching her, waiting, biding its time..",

        The haunting true story of the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California during the 70s and 80s, and of the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case--which was solved in April 2018.
        
        Introduction by Gillian Flynn - Afterword by Patton Oswalt
        
        "A brilliant genre-buster. . . . Propulsive, can't-stop-now reading." --Stephen King
        
        For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.
        
        Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.
        
        I'll Be Gone in the Dark--the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death--offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman's obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Utterly original and compelling, it has been hailed as a modern true crime classic--one which fulfilled Michelle's dream: helping unmask the Golden State Killer.`,

        about:`No one writes about love like Gayle Forman. Lose yourself in her passionate mash note to rock music, indie bookstores and best of all, the miracles that can happen when you take chances on other people. -- E. LOCKHART, #1 New York Times bestselling author of We Were Liars and Again Again

        A poignant and uplifting novel about the power of community, from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of If I Stay.
        
        Aaron Stein used to think books were miracles. But not anymore. Even though he spends his days working in his family's secondhand bookstore, the only book Aaron can bear to read is one about the demise of the dinosaurs. It's a predicament he understands all too well, now that his brother and mom are gone and his friends have deserted him, leaving Aaron and his shambolic father alone in a moldering bookstore in a crusty mountain town where no one seems to read anymore.
        
        So when Aaron sees the opportunity to sell the store, he jumps at it, thinking this is the only way out. But he doesn't account for Chad, a best life bro with a wheelchair and way too much optimism, or the town's out-of-work lumberjacks taking on the failing shop as their pet project. And he certainly doesn't anticipate meeting Hannah, a beautiful, brave musician who might possibly be the kind of inevitable he's been waiting for.
        
        All of them will help Aaron to come to terms with what he's lost, what he's found, who he is, and who he wants to be, and show him that destruction doesn't inevitably lead to extinction; sometimes it leads to the creation of something entirely new.
